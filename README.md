# About

This is basically a practice project to showcase my JavaScript DOM Manipulation Skills.  When the project is initially opened, the user will see a 16x16 grid of squares. When the cursor is moved 
through the squares, the color of the squares will change. After the cursor is moved through a
square  a certain number of times, the given square will turn to black.

The reset grid is used to generate a new grid based on user input. It accepts a value between 1 and
100. A new grid is generated based on this value. For example, if a user inputs 30, then a 30x30 
grid will be generated
